#LexisCode Simple Calculator App

This was developed by me in the year 2020; and on learning Git/GitHub
this year 2022, I've chosen to push it to the control system for public
access.

The languages I used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Btw, that also was done using the Andriod Studio editor (some extra JAVA language was added though).

Happy coding!!
